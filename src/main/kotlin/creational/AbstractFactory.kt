/**
 * Pros:
 * - You can be sure that the products youâ€™re getting from a factory are compatible with each other.
 * - You avoid tight coupling between concrete products and client code.
 * - Single Responsibility Principle. You can extract the product creation code into one place, making the code easier to support.
 * - Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new variants of products without breaking existing client code.
 *
 * Cons:
 * - The code may become more complicated than it should be, since a lot of new interfaces and classes are introduced along with the pattern.
