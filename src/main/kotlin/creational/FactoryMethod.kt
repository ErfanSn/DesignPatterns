/**
 * Pros:
 * - You avoid tight coupling between the creator and the concrete products.
 * - Single Responsibility Principle.
 * You can move the product creation code into one place in the program, making the code easier to support.
 * - Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new types of products into the program without breaking existing client code.
 *
 * Cons:
 * - The code may become more complicated since you need to introduce a lot of new subclasses to implement the pattern.
 * The best case scenario is when youâ€™re introducing the pattern into an existing hierarchy of creator classes.
